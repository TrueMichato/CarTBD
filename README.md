# CarTBD
Like Airbnb, but for cars

## Main Idea
Enabling people to rent their cars on an open market basis, just like Airbnb does for houses. Why buy a car you would use once every two weeks for 4 hours, when you can rent from your next door neighbor?

## Features
- Each user is either rents cars from others, to others, or both.
- Prices are set by the owner, time limits are enforces via fines (payments are handles through the app so payment information is available)
- A map allows you to see the closest cars available
- Both sides of a deal leave reviews. Low reviews might lead to bans?

## Open issues
- Legal Issues with Insurance - need to see how car rentals and rideshares do it
- Parking spots - maybe collaborate with local authorities for benefits
- Car issues - the insurance might cover, but maybe collaborate with autoshops in the area?

## Tech Stack
